# Possible updates to the proposed package
## For the article titled ["Natural Time-Series Analysis and Vedic Hindu Calendar System"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03441) 

Possible updates can be added such that the effects of using the lunisolar calendar over solar calendars can be understood conclusively. In that aspect I would like a couple of updates mentioned below:

1. Python package for VedicDatetime with timedelta object since existing python package sanatantime have few functions to facilitate a full range of operations.
2. As a demo showing, divergent trend and seasonality in stock market monthly P/E ratio between two types of calendars. This would give a better understanding of the effects of solar and lunisolar calendars in business use cases where the unequal length of months affects the analysis.
